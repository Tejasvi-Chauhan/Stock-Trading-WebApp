# Stock Trading Web Application

This is a personal learning project built to understand full-stack web development using React and Node.js.

The main goal of this project was to understand frontend and backend communication through APIs.

- Buy and sell stocks (simulation)
- Portfolio overview
- API-based data flow between frontend and backend

## Learning Outcomes
- React component structure and state management
- API integration using fetch / axios
- Backend API creation with Node.js and Express
- Database connectivity and CRUD operations
- Understanding full-stack application flow

## Project Status
This is a personal learning project and is still under development.  


## How to Run (Optional)
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start backend and frontend servers
4. Configure environment variables if required
